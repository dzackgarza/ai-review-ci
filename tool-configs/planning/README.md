# QC Ignore Justifications

Every global suppression in QC tool configuration must be justified here in prose.
No suppression is accepted without a written justification traceable to domain
constraints, naming conventions, or architectural realities that the tool was not
designed to accommodate.

Rule: if a finding can be fixed in code without violating project style docs or
mathematical conventions, fix the code.
If it cannot, justify the ignore here.
No third category ("too hard," “not worth it,” "phase-appropriate").

## ruff E741: Ambiguous variable name detection

**Status**: Globally disabled in `ruff-global.toml`.

**What the rule does**: Flags single-character variable names that are visually
ambiguous with numerals or other characters — `I` (vs `l`), `O` (vs `0`), `l` (vs `1`).

**Why we disable it**:

Mathematical code uses single-letter identifiers as standard notation.
This is not lazy naming — it is the canonical surface language of algebra, and replacing
these identifiers with descriptive names would make the code _less_ readable to its
domain audience:

- `I` for an ideal is universal in commutative algebra and algebraic number theory.
  Replacing it with `the_ideal` or `ideal_obj` obscures the mathematical intent.
  A reader of algebraic code expects `I = R.ideal(6)` the same way they expect `i` for a
  loop index in imperative code.

- `R` for a ring, `M` for a module, `G` for a group, `V` for a vector space, `K` for a
  field, `L` for a lattice — these are the standard identifiers in every algebra
  textbook and Sage tutorial.
  Forcing `the_ring`, `the_module` is actively harmful to readability.

- `O` for an object in category-theoretic code follows the same pattern: objects of a
  category are conventionally denoted by single letters.

The `research-code-style` skill mandates: “All code must read like mathematical prose,
and semantically follow either a definition or a theorem.”
Mathematical prose uses single-letter identifiers for algebraic objects.
E741 contradicts this mandate.

The rule also has no mechanism for context: `I` in a function called
`_install_ideal_patch` is clearly an ideal, not a typo for `l`. E741 has no scope-level
granularity — it is either on or off per configuration.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Per-file `# noqa: E741` comments could be placed at every `I =` assignment site.
  Rejected: this would scatter comments across ~50+ files and is brittle (new `I =`
  assignments would produce new violations).
  The convention is universal, not exceptional.

- Raising the specificity to only suppress within `tests/` or `src/` directories.
  Rejected: the convention is equally valid in all math code, and a directory-scoped
  disable is harder to discover than a global one with a documented justification.

- Renaming variables to `ideal_` or `ideal_obj`. Rejected: degrades readability and
  violates the code-style mandate.

**Scope**: All projects.
E741 is disabled globally because mathematical code using standard algebraic identifiers
is not limited to the research repo — it appears in any project that does commutative
algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, representation theory, or category theory
work.

**Review cadence**: If ruff ever adds a context-aware variant of E741 that accepts `I`
when assigned from known ideal constructors, or a per-pattern allowlist, this ignore
should be replaced with that narrower mechanism.

## ruff UP049: Private type parameter names in PEP 695 generics

**Status**: Globally disabled in `ruff-global.toml`.

**Governance note**: All entries in this file are human-justified decisions made with
explicit human review and sign-off.
Agents must never add entries to this file or add rules to `ruff-global.toml` without
explicit human-in-the-loop approval.
The permitted agent action is to flag a candidate rule for human review — not to make
the decision unilaterally.

**What the rule does**: In PEP 695 type parameter syntax (`def f[T: Bound](...)`), flags
type parameters whose names begin with `_` and renames them to drop the leading
underscore.

**Why we disable it**:

The `_` prefix on a name communicates _intent_ to human readers: this identifier is an
internal implementation detail, not part of the public API surface.
This convention is well-established in Python and universally understood.
UP049’s premise — that the leading underscore is unnecessary because PEP 695 type
parameters are always function-scoped — conflates two distinct purposes of the `_`
convention:

- **Scoping signal**: “this name is not importable from outside the module.”
  UP049 is correct that PEP 695 type parameters are always locally scoped, so `_` adds
  nothing for scoping purposes.

- **Readability signal**: “this name is an internal mechanism; readers of call sites and
  subclasses need not concern themselves with it.”
  This purpose is entirely independent of scoping and is not addressed by PEP 695.

**Policy**: `tool-configs/ruff-global.toml` disables UP049 globally.
Internal PEP 695 wrapper type parameters keep their leading `_` prefix.

**Why required**: `_CatCachedMethod`, `_BilinearCachedMethod`,
`_FieldCachedMethod`, and the same wrapper-function type parameters are internal
implementation types. Dropping `_` marks those internal names as public API while
changing no runtime contract, type-checking contract, subclassing contract, or user
documentation surface.

**Owner**: `tool-configs/ruff-global.toml` owns the rule through
`ignore = ["E741", "UP049"]`. The command path is `just test` → Python QC → Ruff
normalization. Per-function `# noqa: UP049` comments are not the policy mechanism.

**Scope**: All projects.
The readability argument for `_`-prefixed type parameters applies universally to any
codebase with internal generic wrapper functions.

**Review cadence**: If PEP 695 tooling develops a mechanism to mark type parameters as
explicitly non-public (analogous to `__all__` for modules), this ignore should be
replaced with that mechanism.
