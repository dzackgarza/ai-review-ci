# Quality Control System

Before configuring, running, or modifying Quality Control checks, consult the central policy index: [policy-index](../policy-index/SKILL.md)

The global quality control system at `~/ai-review-ci` provides centralized linting, typechecking, formatting, complexity analysis, and code quality enforcement for all projects.
It is the single source of truth for QC workflows.

## Authority Hierarchy

When skill policies conflict, the following authority order determines which rule prevails.
A domain skill may narrow these policies for its domain but may not weaken them.

| Rank | Skill | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | `quality-control` | Generic QC invocation, public recipes, tool pins, configs, and justfile architecture (shared + language-specific). No local reimplementation. |
| **2** | `test-guidelines` | Testing epistemology: what constitutes a proof, no mocks, no exceptions, no masking. |
| **3** | `tool-provisioning-and-environment-hygiene` | How tools run: ephemeral by default, uv-only Python, no pipx/pip/global npm. |
| **4** | `known-solution-first` | External tool/compiler/API uncertainty: public contracts before local probing. |
| **5** | `reality-grounded-debugging` | Diagnostic command discipline: stderr preservation, surface classification before mutation. |
| **6** | `writing-scripts-and-cli-interfaces` | CLI design patterns, project-owned dependency decisions, standalone script templates. |
| **7** | Domain skills | May narrow higher-ranked policies within their domain but may not weaken them. |

**Policy narrowing rule:** A domain skill may impose stricter requirements than a higher-ranked skill (e.g., `test-guidelines` may add prohibitions beyond `quality-control`'s defaults).
It may not relax them (e.g., no skill may permit mocks or pytest-mock).

**When a lower-ranked skill contradicts a higher-ranked skill, the higher-ranked skill wins.** If `test-driven-development` says "mocks if unavoidable" and `test-guidelines` says "no mocks, no exceptions," `test-guidelines` wins.
If `clean-code` says "start with try/catch" and `python-patterns` says "fail fast, no speculative try/catch," `python-patterns` (as a domain skill narrowing tool-provisioning's fail-loud doctrine) wins.

The hierarchy is designed so that no skill below rank 3 can re-introduce mock seams, local QC reimplementation, or global tool installation.

## High-Level Policies

### Minimal Public API

**Only two public recipes exist:** `test` and `test-ci`. Everything else is private (prefixed with `_`). This prevents cherry-picking — agents cannot run just `lint` or just `typecheck` in isolation to bypass the stack.

The two recipes are tiered:

- **`test` (commit gate, run by `pre-commit`)** — correctness + normalization only: preflight, shared normalization + language auto-fixers, syntax, type-checking (mypy/tsc/clippy), the project's own tests with **no** coverage threshold, and bypass-comment detection.
  Its job is to catch *plainly incorrect* code while keeping the tree normalized, without dragging full slop triage into every commit.
- **`test-ci` (push gate, run by `pre-push`)** — depends on `test` and adds the full *style/slop/coverage* stack: 100% coverage + diff-cover, deptry, import-linter, dead-code (vulture/grain/knip), jscpd, lizard, ast-grep, semgrep, vibecheck, and ai-slop.
  This is the complete pipeline; it must pass before pushing.

### Auto-Fix Enforcement: Always Apply All Available Fixes

**Rule:** Agents MUST always apply all available auto-fixes when running any default recipe (`just test`, `just test-ci`). This is not optional, not a "best effort," and not conditional on whether failures are expected.
Mutating normalization runs first.
Verification checks run second against the post-fix tree.

#### What happens when you run `just test`

The `test` recipe runs common normalization before language-specific normalization and before verification checks.
This applies every deterministic auto-fix the toolchain supports:

**Common stack (`~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/shared.just`):**
| Tool | Flag | Fixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `prettier` | `--write` | Markdown, JSON, and YAML whitespace/newline/style normalization |
| `semgrep` | `--autofix --error` | Security and quality pattern fixes before tests; fails if blocking findings remain |

**Python stack (`~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just`):**
| Tool | Flag | Fixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff check` | `--fix` | Lint errors (E, F, I, UP) — unused imports, import sorting, pyupgrade patterns |
| `ruff format` | (implicit) | PEP 8 style formatting |
| `grain` | `--fix` | Unused code removal |

**TypeScript stack (`~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/bun.just`):**
| Tool | Flag | Fixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `biome check` | `--write --unsafe` | Formatter, linter, import sorting — safe and unsafe fixes |
| `eslint` | `--fix` | Lint rule auto-fixes |

**Rust stack (`~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/rust.just`):**
| Tool | Flag | Fixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt` | (implicit) | Rust source formatting before `rustfmt --check`, clippy, and tests |

Late verification gates such as `semgrep`, `rustfmt --check`, `biome check`, `eslint --max-warnings 0`, and `just --list` parse checks must not be the first place deterministic style issues are discovered when a stable autoformatter exists.
They verify that normalization succeeded.
The auto-fixers in the tables above run in the commit-tier `test`; the heavier verification gates (`semgrep`, `biome check`, `eslint --max-warnings 0`, ai-slop, complexity, coverage) run in the push-tier `test-ci`.

#### What agents MUST do

- **Run `just test` for the commit gate and `just test-ci` for the full stack (not individual checks).** Auto-fix runs in both.
  Before pushing, `just test-ci` must pass.
  Do not run `ruff` or `biome` or `eslint` in isolation — the recipe handles all of them in the right order with the right flags.

- **Never skip the auto-fix step.** If `just test` passes without changes, fine.
  If it applies fixes, those fixes are part of the intended output — they are not noise.
  Commit them.

- **If a tool has an auto-fix flag that is not wired into the recipe, wire it in.** Do not apply it manually and leave the recipe stale.
  The justfile is the single source of truth.
  Add the flag and document it in this table.

- **Never use bypass comments (`# noqa`, `@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`, etc.) as a substitute for letting auto-fix do its job.** The [No-Bypass Policy](#no-bypass-policy) is stricter than any individual tool's silence mechanism.

#### Why this rule exists

Without an explicit auto-fix requirement, agents routinely:

- Run checks without fixing, see failures, and reach for bypass comments instead of letting the tool fix itself
- Run `ruff check` without `--fix` (diagnostic only), then manually "fix" issues that `--fix` would have handled automatically
- Apply fixes manually to a subset of files while leaving the rest broken
- Skip auto-fix entirely and report "lint pass" when the actual fix step was never run

This is not a performance optimization.
It is an epistemic integrity requirement: the state of the code after `just test` must be the state that was actually checked.

### Full Stack, No Exceptions

`just test-ci` runs the complete QC pipeline; `just test` runs the commit-tier subset (correctness + normalization) that it builds on.
There is no separate `just lint` or `just typecheck` for agents to use.
Running only typecheck is insufficient — the commit gate must pass to commit, and the full `test-ci` stack must pass before pushing.

### No-Bypass Policy

Bypass comments are explicitly blocked in staged files:

- `# pragma: no cover` — Python coverage bypass

- `// istanbul ignore` — JS coverage bypass

- `# noqa` — Python lint bypass

- `# type: ignore` — Python type bypass

- `@ts-ignore` — TS type bypass

- `@ts-expect-error` without comment — TS expect-error without justification

- `// eslint-disable` — ESLint bypass

**Rule:** Fix the underlying issue, never hide it with a bypass comment.
If you find yourself needing a bypass, escalate to the user for QC agent review/approval instead.

### Hard-Fail Doctrine: No Soft Skips

**Rule:** Every QC recipe MUST hard-fail (`exit 1`) when its prerequisites are absent.
There is no "Skipping: no X found; exit 0" path.
QC failure is `exit 1` — always.

This covers all prerequisite types:

| Missing prerequisite | Example failure |
| --- | --- |
| No source files of the correct language | Python QC finds no `.py` files |
| No tests | `_pytest_with_coverage` finds no test files |
| No project config | `_deptry`/`_pytest_with_coverage` finds no `pyproject.toml` |
| No tool config | `_import-linter` finds no `.importlinter` or `[tool.import-linter]` |
| No tool installation | `_codeql` finds `codeql` CLI not on `PATH` |
| No coverage output | `_diff-cover` finds no `coverage.xml`/`lcov.info` from preceding step |

**Rationale:** QC is not optional, not best-effort, not advisory.
If a prerequisite is missing, the project is misconfigured — the correct response is a hard failure with a clear error message telling the developer what to fix, not a silent green check.

#### Failure modes this policy exists to prevent

These are concrete misunderstandings that occurred during development and must not recur:

1. **"Missing source files are OK — the tool has nothing to scan, so skip silently."** Wrong.
   If the QC justfile for a language runs on a project and finds no source files of that language, that means either the project is using the wrong justfile (should map to a different language stack) or the project has no source code (not a real project).
   Both are configuration errors that must fail loudly.

2. **"Missing tool installations are OK — skip gracefully if the CLI is not on PATH."** Wrong.
   Every tool in the QC chain is mandatory.
   If CodeQL is not installed, QC must fail with an error telling the developer to install it.
   Silently skipping means the QC result is incomplete, which defeats the purpose of having a QC system.

3. **"Missing project config files are OK — skip the check that depends on them."** Wrong.
   If `pyproject.toml` is missing (or `tsconfig.json`, or `.importlinter`), the project is not properly configured.
   QC must fail, not amputate the check.

4. **"It's OK for a recipe to `exit 0` with a 'skipping' message."** Wrong.
   `exit 0` is a success signal.
   A check that did not run is not a success — it is a gap in the QC pipeline.
   The test runner and CI both interpret `exit 0` as "all good."
   Silent gaps produce false confidence.

**What a hard failure looks like:**

```
ERROR: vulture: no Python files found in a Python project.
```

Not:

```
Skipping vulture: no Python files found.
exit 0
```

The error message must name the tool, the missing prerequisite, and (when applicable) the remediation (e.g., "Install CodeQL from https://github.com/github/codeql-cli").

### Fail-Fast Preflight Gates

**Rule:** Every language `test` recipe runs preflight checks before any QC tooling.
These checks validate project configuration and fail fast on misconfiguration, producing clear error messages instead of confusing tool failures.

Each language justfile has a dedicated `_check-*-project` recipe that runs first in the `test` dependency chain, followed by the shared `_check-no-local-qc-override` (imported from `justfile`). These run before `_normalize`, linters, typecheckers, tests, or any other QC tool.

#### Shared Preflight: `_check-no-local-qc-override`

Location: `justfile` (imported by all language justfiles).

Detects local copies of global QC config files in the project root.
Global QC owns these tool configs — local overrides are forbidden:

| Config file | Tool | Why it's an override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `semgrep.yml` | Semgrep | Global QC owns semgrep security rules |
| `.jscpd.json` | jscpd | Global QC owns copy-paste detection config |
| `.slopconfig.yaml` | ai-slop-detector | Global QC owns slop detection config |
| `sgconfig.yml` | ast-grep | Global QC owns AST pattern rules |

If any of these files exist in the project root, the check fails with:

```
ERROR: Local QC override detected: semgrep.yml — global QC owns this tool config.
       DELETE this file. The global config for this tool already exists in
       ~/ai-review-ci/ and is authoritative for all projects.
       Do NOT copy or move this file to ~/ai-review-ci/ — that violates
       QC isolation policy. If the global config needs to change, contact
       the QC owner (dzack) to update it centrally.
```

#### Python Preflight: `_check-python-project`

Location: `justfile-python`

Validates:

1. **`pyproject.toml` exists** — Python QC requires a project config.
2. **`requires-python` targets >=3.14** — Global QC pins to Python 3.14. If the project targets an older Python, tool versions and type stubs may not align.
3. **No local QC tool overrides in `pyproject.toml` sections** — The following sections are owned by global QC and must not be set locally: `[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.mypy]`, `[tool.coverage]`, `[tool.deptry]`, `[tool.vulture]`, `[tool.import-linter]`.
4. **No standalone Python tool config files** — `ruff.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, `mypy.ini`, `.mypy.ini`, `grain.toml`, `.coveragerc`, `.importlinter`.
5. **Tests must exist** — At least one file matching `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, or `tests/*.py`.

#### TypeScript Preflight: `_check-ts-project`

Location: `justfile-bun`

Validates:

1. **`package.json` exists** — TypeScript QC requires a package manifest.
2. **Bun is the package manager** — `bun.lock` or `bun.lockb` must exist.
3. **No local QC tool config overrides** — `biome.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `knip.json`, `.lintstagedrc.json`, `.lintstagedrc.mjs`.
4. **`tsconfig.json` does not set `strict: false`** — TypeScript strict mode is required by global QC.
5. **Tests must exist** — At least one file matching `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.spec.tsx`, or a `tests/` directory.

#### Rust Preflight: `_check-rust-project`

Location: `justfile-rust`

Validates:

1. **At least one `Cargo.toml` exists anywhere in the repository** — Rust QC supports nested Rust layouts such as Tauri projects where the manifest lives in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
2. **Tests must exist** — Either a `tests/` directory or `#[test]` functions in source files.

#### Missing Tests: Test-Writing Triage

Missing tests are not routed through ordinary QC triage.
A project with source code and no tests needs a separate proof-design workflow, because immediately fixing application code or adding placeholder tests launders the absence of proof into a generic QC failure.

When a language preflight reports missing tests, it emits the `TEST-WRITING TRIAGE REQUIRED` directive and points agents to the global `test-writing` and `test-guidelines` skills.
The required workflow is:

- A subagent defines the repository's real-world proof obligations: owned behavior, user-visible boundaries, real fixtures/data, and assertions that would prove the behavior.
- A separate subagent writes and locks in those tests, observes them fail for the expected reason, and commits the red tests.
- The main agent changes application code until those tests pass.
- If the main agent believes a test is wrong, it may not edit the test or instruct a fixer to edit it.
  It must ask the same test-writing subagent, or a fresh neutral subagent primed on all policies and testing guidelines, for an unbiased verdict.
  The verdict determines whether the app changes or the validating subagent updates the test.

#### Why preflight gates exist

Without fail-fast preflight checks, a misconfigured project produces confusing errors from individual tools: "ruff: No such file or directory" (wrong Python version), "error: Cannot find module" (wrong package manager), or "0 tests collected" (no tests, but exit 0). These are hard to distinguish from legitimate transient failures.

Preflight gates convert misconfiguration into a single clear message:

```
ERROR: Python project must have tests. No test files found with patterns: test_*.py, *_test.py, tests/*.py
```

This is a hard fail (`exit 1`). Misconfiguration is not a warning — it blocks QC.

#### Failure mode this policy exists to prevent

**"The project just needs a quick local override — a one-line change to ruff config."** Wrong.
Tool configs are owned by global QC. Overrides weaken the uniform QC standard and create an unmaintainable patchwork of project-specific exceptions.
The correct action is to escalate to the QC owner, who may update the global config for all projects.

### ML Model Preflight: `_slop` requires trained classifier

**Rule:** The `_slop` recipe in the shared `justfile` runs an ML-based code quality detector (`ai-slop-detector`) which requires a trained classifier model at `models/slop_classifier.pkl`. The recipe checks for this file before running the detector and fails hard if it is missing:

```
ERROR: ai-slop-detector ML model not found: /home/dzack/ai-review-ci/tool-artifacts/models/slop_classifier.pkl
  Run: uv run tool-artifacts/scripts/train_slop_model.py
```

Without this check, `ai-slop-detector` silently disables ML scoring and falls back to rule-based analysis only — the ML signal is lost with no indication to the user.

#### Regenerating the model

The model is trained from synthetic data and tracked as a binary artifact in the QC repo.
To regenerate:

```bash
cd ~/ai-review-ci
uv run tool-artifacts/scripts/train_slop_model.py
```

The training script (`tool-artifacts/scripts/train_slop_model.py`) uses `ai-slop-detector`'s `MLPipeline` to generate 1000 synthetic samples (500 slop, 500 clean), extract features from each, and train an ensemble classifier (RandomForest + XGBoost).
The trained model is written to `models/slop_classifier.pkl`.

Because the model is trained on synthetic data, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) are expected to be near-perfect on the synthetic test set.
This is a diagnostic baseline, not a guarantee of real-world performance.

Dependencies are declared as PEP 723 inline metadata; `uv run` provisions them automatically.
On Linux, `xgboost` pulls in `nvidia-nccl-cu12` — this is a declared dependency, not a working-around.

#### Failure mode this policy exists to prevent

**"The slop detector ran but the ML classifier silently fell back to rule-based only."** The `ai-slop-detector` tool's `MLScorer.from_model()` returns `None` when the model file is missing, logging `[DEBUG] Model not found: models/slop_classifier.pkl — ML scoring disabled`. Without the preflight check, this produces no error, no warning visible at default log level, and no CI failure — the tool completes with exit 0 while the ML signal is entirely absent.

### Language Isolation: One Language per Justfile

**Rule:** Each justfile owns exactly one language stack.
No recipe in the Python justfile may depend on JS/TS files existing.
No recipe in the TS justfile may depend on Python files existing.

| Justfile | Type | Recipes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `shared.just` | Shared (cross-language) | `_normalize-common`, `_format-structured-text`, `_semgrep-autofix`, `_no-bypass`, `_semgrep`, `_vibecheck`, `_slop` — language-agnostic normalization and QC. Called explicitly by language justfiles; not intended for standalone invocation outside QC composition. |
| `python.just` | Python | Python-specific: `_python-syntax`, `_mypy`, `_normalize`, etc. Calls shared normalization and shared global QC by `just -f shared.just`. |
| `bun.just` | TypeScript/JS | TypeScript-specific: `_biome`, `_eslint`, `_tsc`, `_knip`, etc. Calls shared normalization and shared global QC by `just -f shared.just`. |
| `rust.just` | Rust | Rust-specific: `_normalize`, `_clippy`, `_rustfmt`, `_cargo-test`, etc. Calls shared normalization and shared global QC by `just -f shared.just`. |
| `sage.just` | SageMath | Sage-specific: `_sage-syntax`, `_vulture` (Sage-aware). Calls shared normalization and shared QC; calls Python QC via `just -f python.just`. |

#### Failure mode this policy exists to prevent

**"It doesn't matter which justfile a recipe lives in — recipes are just scripts."** Wrong.
A Python-justfile recipe that checks for `.ts` files will hard-fail on a pure Python project (no `.ts` files exist), falsely indicating a QC failure.
This is a configuration error: the recipe belongs in the TS justfile, not the Python one.
Cross-contamination creates false negatives on correct projects and makes the QC system impossible to reason about.

**Cross-contamination pattern (prohibited):**

```
# Python justfile — WRONG: contains JS/TS-specific recipes
_js-qc-files:          # does not belong here — hard-fails when no .ts files exist
_slop-scan:            # does not belong here — hard-fails on pure Python projects
```

**Correct separation:**

```
# Python justfile
test: _normalize-common _normalize _python-syntax _mypy ...   # common normalization, then Python tools

# TS justfile
test: _normalize-common _normalize _knip _biome _slop-scan ...  # common normalization, then TS tools
```

Running the wrong justfile for a project also fails — if Python QC runs on a project with no Python files, every recipe that checks for `.py` files will exit 1. This is correct: the developer is using the wrong justfile.

### No Optional Tools

#### Failure mode this policy exists to prevent

**"CodeQL is a security scanner — it's optional, not a core quality check."** Wrong.
Every tool in the global QC chain was deliberately included.
Making any tool optional creates a precedent for cherry-picking: "this project doesn't need deptry," "this project doesn't need import-linter," "semgrep is overkill here."
Over time, the full stack degrades into whatever subset an agent subjectively decides is "appropriate."
The QC system is not negotiable per-project.

**Rule:** Every tool in the QC chain is mandatory.
There is no "skip if not installed", no `command -v tool || exit 0`, no graceful degradation.

| Tool | Behavior if missing | Before (wrong) | After (correct) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codeql` | Hard fail | `exit 0` "Skipping CodeQL: CLI not installed" | `exit 1` "ERROR: Install CodeQL from ..." |
| `deptry` | Hard fail | `exit 0` "Skipping: no pyproject.toml" | `exit 1` "ERROR: no pyproject.toml found" |
| `import-linter` | Hard fail | `exit 0` "Skipping: no config" | `exit 1` "ERROR: no config found" |

If a tool cannot be installed or configured, QC is blocked until it is.
This is by design: QC must be complete to pass.

### Ephemeral Tools

#### Failure mode this policy exists to prevent

**"Tools need to be installed globally with `npm install -g` or `pip install` to be available."** Wrong.
Global installs pollute the system Python and node environments, create version conflicts with project-local dependencies, and are invisible unless you know to look.
Every tool in the QC stack has a working ephemeral runner (`uvx`, `bun x`, `npx -y`). If a tool cannot run ephemerally, it is the wrong tool — replace it, don't install it globally.

**Rule:** All tools run via ephemeral runners (`uvx`, `bun x`, `npx -y`). No permanent global or local installation of QC tools is permitted.
See `tool-provisioning-and-environment-hygiene` (rank 3 in the authority hierarchy).

| Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- |
| `uvx --from ruff ruff check --fix` | `pip install ruff && ruff check` |
| `bun x biome check` | `bun add --global @biomejs/biome && biome check` |
| `npx -y --package @ast-grep/cli ast-grep scan` | `npm install -g @ast-grep/cli && ast-grep scan` |

**Sole exception:** ESLint flat config requires its plugins to be locally installed in `~/ai-review-ci/tool-configs/node_modules/` because the flat config uses ES module imports that resolve relative to the config file's directory.
This exception is documented at the recipe site in `_eslint-deps`. No other tool may use this exception.

### Bridge-Burning Policies

Adhering to the [Bridge-Burning Policies](../anti-slop/SKILL.md#bridge-burning-policies) is a non-negotiable constraint for all development.
These rules eliminate common agent validation-evasion pathways (such as runtime defaults, fallbacks, mocks, and diagnostic smoke tests in proof paths).

Any exception to these rules must strictly follow the **Policy Exception Protocol** defined in [anti-slop.md](../anti-slop/SKILL.md#policy-exception-protocol).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bridge-Burning Red Flags:** If a construct would let an agent preserve the appearance of correctness while weakening the obligation, treat it as a red flag even if the code currently works.
> For a comprehensive catalog of code signatures, keywords, and patterns to look for, see the [Bridge-Burning Red Flags Reference Catalog](../policy-index/references/red-flags.md) and the [Runtime Control-Flow Red Flags Catalog](../policy-index/references/runtime-control-flow.md).

## Purpose

1. **Enshrine workflows** — Every workflow lives in the justfile.
   No ad-hoc scripts, no “I’ll just run this command directly”.
   Justfile is the single source of truth for project operations.

2. **Fix opinionated workflows** — Agents cannot cherry-pick checks.
   For example, `just typecheck` does NOT assert code quality — the `test` recipe runs the full QC stack.
   Running only typecheck is insufficient.

3. **Abstract complexity** — Env management, sandbox setup, tool installation, common tasks — all hidden in private recipes.
   Users run workflows, not infrastructure.

## Justfile Architecture

The QC system uses one shared justfile (`shared.just`) and multiple language-specific justfiles.
Language justfiles call shared recipes explicitly with `just -f shared.just` so language-specific recipe names can remain isolated without import conflicts.

### Shared Justfile (`justfile`)

Location: `~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/shared.just`

Cross-language recipes called by language justfiles:

- `_normalize-common` — Runs common mutating normalization before language checks
- `_format-structured-text` — Formats Markdown, JSON, and YAML with Prettier
- `_semgrep-autofix` — Applies Semgrep autofixes before later verification
- `_no-bypass` — Blocks bypass comments (`# noqa`, `@ts-ignore`, `# type: ignore`, etc.)
- `_semgrep` — Security and quality pattern verification
- `_vibecheck` — Anti-slop pattern detection
- `_slop` — ML-based code quality detection (preflight checks `models/slop_classifier.pkl`; fails hard if model file missing)

This file is **not** intended for standalone invocation.
Language justfiles compose its recipes into their `test` chains.

### Python: `justfile-python`

Location: `~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just`

Shared recipe composition: calls `shared.just` explicitly.

Recipes: `_normalize-common` wrapper, `_python-syntax`, `_mypy`, `_normalize` (ruff), `_pytest_with_coverage`, `_diff-cover`, `_vulture`, `_deptry`, `_import-linter`, `_grain`, `_ast-grep`, `_jscpd-python`, `_lizard-python`, `_codeql` plus shared recipe calls.

Invocations:

- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just -d . test`
- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just -d . test-ci`

### TypeScript: `justfile-bun`

Location: `~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/bun.just`

Shared recipe composition: calls `shared.just` explicitly.

Recipes: `_normalize-common` wrapper, `_normalize` (biome + eslint), `_coverage`, `_diff-cover`, `_knip`, `_biome`, `_eslint`, `_tsc`, `_ast-grep`, `_jscpd`, `_lizard`, `_codeql`, `_slop-scan`, `_lint-staged` plus shared recipe calls.

Invocations:

- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/bun.just -d . test`
- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/bun.just -d . test-ci`

### Rust: `justfile-rust`

Location: `~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/rust.just`

Shared recipe composition: calls `shared.just` explicitly.

Recipes: `_normalize-common` wrapper, `_normalize` (cargo fmt), `_clippy`, `_rustfmt`, `_cargo-test`, `_jscpd`, `_lizard`, `_codeql` plus shared recipe calls.

Invocations:

- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/rust.just -d . test`
- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/rust.just -d . test-ci`

### SageMath: `justfile-sage`

Location: `~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/sage.just`

Shared recipe composition: calls `shared.just` explicitly.
Calls Python QC via `just -f python.just` subcommands.

Recipes: `_normalize-common` wrapper, `_sage-syntax`, `_vulture` (Sage-aware preparse), plus shared and Python recipe calls.

Invocations:

- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/sage.just -d . test`
- `just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/sage.just -d . test-ci`

### Shared Composition Rule

Do not import `shared.just` into language justfiles.
Shared composition is explicit: language recipes call `just -f {{justfiles}}/shared.just ...`. This prevents recipe-name conflicts while keeping cross-language normalization and global QC centralized.

Shared recipes must stay language-agnostic.
Language-specific recipes like `_jscpd-python`, `_lizard-python`, `_jscpd-bun`, and `_lizard-bun` stay in their language justfiles because their invocation flags differ per language.

## Usage in Local Projects

**Never reimplement QC locally.** Local justfiles must delegate to the appropriate language justfile:

**Python projects:**

```justfile
# my-project/justfile

## Extending for Repo-Specific Testing

The global QC stack covers cross-project baselines: lint, typecheck, coverage, complexity, copy-paste, and slop detection.
Individual projects may extend these with **domain-specific semantic tests** that target their unique correctness requirements and the failure modes LLMs systematically produce.

**Before adding any local QC extension, classify the check per the QC Extension Gate below.** Extensions are only permitted for project-owned semantic tests.
Generic, reusable, or tool-configuration steps must be promoted to global QC — they do not belong in local recipes or dev dependencies.

### QC Ownership

**Global QC owns:**

- generic linting, formatting, typechecking
- coverage machinery and thresholds
- bypass detection
- complexity checks, copy-paste detection, dead-code detection
- slop detectors and anti-pattern detectors
- tool versions and pins (ruff, mypy, biome, eslint, etc.)
- generic tool config files
- generic runner strategy (how tests execute, what gates compose)

**The project owns:**

- runtime dependencies
- build dependencies truly required by the project
- domain tests proving repository-owned behavior
- fixtures and real data needed by those tests
- minimal private adapters that connect project-specific tests to the global gate

**The project does not own:**

- its own generic lint/type/format/coverage stack
- duplicate tool pins
- local replacements for global QC
- public `lint`, `typecheck`, `coverage`, `check`, or similar QC recipes
- local scripts that should be global QC detectors
- generic QC tool installs in dev dependencies

### QC Extension Gate

Before adding any project-local QC recipe, script, tool config, or dev dependency, classify the check:

1. **Does it verify this repository's domain semantics using project-owned fixtures/data?**
   - If yes: it may be local, private, and composed into `test`.
   - If no: continue.

2. **Could the same check apply to another repository?**
   - If yes: it belongs in `~/ai-review-ci`, not this repo.

3. **Does it encode a known LLM failure mode or anti-slop detector?**
   - If yes: promote it to global QC.

4. **Does it require a generic tool version, config file, ignore rule, or invocation pattern?**
   - If yes: global QC owns the tool/config/invocation.
     Do not pin it locally.

5. **Is it just a narrower way to run lint/typecheck/format/test/coverage?**
   - Reject it.
     Use the global recipe.

Local QC extensions are allowed only for project-owned semantic tests.
Reusable QC practices must be promoted upward.

### Promotion Pathway

When an agent wants to add a local QC step, it must classify it per the Extension Gate above.
Additionally:

- If the step catches a recurring LLM failure mode, it belongs in global QC.
- If the step appears useful in more than one repo, promote it to global QC.
- If unsure, do not add local QC silently; report the classification and ask for QC-owner direction.

Any change that adds project-local QC must report one of:

- "This is domain-specific and should remain local because \_\_\_."
- "This is reusable and was promoted to global QC in \_\_\_."
- "This appears reusable but was not promoted because \_\_\_; QC-owner follow-up is required."

### Mutation Testing

Mutation testing verifies that tests actually catch defects by introducing controlled code mutations (flipping conditionals, swapping operators, deleting statements) and asserting the test suite fails on each mutant.
A surviving mutant means tests are insufficient — the code might be buggy but the tests are too weak to notice.

**Tools by language:**

- Python: `mutmut`, `mutpy`
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `stryker`
- Rust: `cargo-mutants`
- Java/Kotlin: `pitest`
- Go: `go-mutesting`

**Target:** Core logic modules — business rules, data transformations, public APIs.
Do not waste mutations on trivial getters/setters or framework glue.

### Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing asserts invariants over random inputs instead of hard-coding examples.
This catches edge cases, off-by-one errors, type-incorrect assumptions, and "works on my examples" reasoning — all common LLM failure modes.

**Tools by language:**

- Python: `hypothesis`, `crosshair` (symbolic/contract-based PBT)
- TypeScript/JavaScript: `fast-check`
- Rust: `proptest`, `quickcheck`
- Java/Kotlin: `jqwik`, `quickcheck`
- Go: `gopter`, `rapid`
- C++: `RapidCheck`

**Target:** Parsing, serialization, indexing, boundary computations, and any function processing unbounded or untrusted input.

**Adversarial seeding:** Seed generators with values known to trigger LLM slop — empty collections, sentinel values, mixed encodings, deeply nested structures, extreme numeric ranges, overlapping intervals.

### Adversarial Design Against LLM Failure Modes

Tests must be explicitly designed to detect what LLMs systematically get wrong.
The following modalities are hard to game without actual correctness:

- **Gaming modalities:** LLMs learn to produce synthetic success signals — tests that pass trivially, coverage that exercises only happy paths, assertions that check tautologies.
  Mutation testing and property-based testing are the primary countermeasures because they cannot be satisfied by mimicking test structure.
- **Slop patterns:** Redundant assertions, tautological checks (e.g., `assert x is not None` without asserting actual values), testing only constructors or trivial getters, mocking external dependencies to avoid real integration testing, bypass comments (`# pragma: no cover`, `# type: ignore`).
- **Failure modes:** Off-by-one errors, swapped arguments, silent truncation, broken error handling (`except: pass`), assumptions about input shape, mixing mutability and immutability, ignoring return values.

### Structural Validation and Contract Enforcement

Projects must enforce data contracts at every boundary — API ingress, storage serialization, inter-service communication, and configuration loading.
LLMs systematically produce type-incorrect or shape-incorrect data handling; structural validation catches these at runtime or compile time without brittle regex heuristics.

**Python:**

- `pydantic` — runtime data validation with type coercion, JSON schema export, and strict mode.
  Enforced via mypy's pydantic plugin.
- `msgspec` — fast serialization with schema enforcement.
- `dataclasses` with `@dataclass(slots=True, frozen=True)` — structural invariants where pydantic is overkill.

**TypeScript/JavaScript:**

- `zod`, `io-ts`, `valibot` — runtime schema validation at API and storage boundaries.
- TypeScript interfaces and types with `strict: true` in tsconfig — compile-time structural enforcement.

**Rust:**

- `serde` with `#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]` — compile-time contract enforcement for serialization boundaries.

**Go:**

- Struct tags with `go-playground/validator` — runtime boundary enforcement.

**Integration:** QC does not enforce specific libraries via fragile grep patterns.
Instead, projects add targeted recipes that use the actual tooling:

- `_validate-models` — runs pydantic or zod validation on known model files
- `_schema-roundtrip` — property tests asserting serialize → deserialize → identity for all boundary types
- `_strict-compile` — tsc or mypy with strictest-available config

### How to Extend (Domain-Specific Only, After Gate Classification)

Project justfiles must NOT modify the global QC recipes.
Instead, wrap the global `test` and add project-specific (domain-owned) steps:

```justfile
# my-project/justfile
test:
  @just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just -d . test
  @just _mutation-test
  @just _property-test
  @just _validate-models

_mutation-test:
  uv run mutmut run --paths-to-mutate src/my_project/

_property-test:
  uv run pytest tests/property/ -x -q

_validate-models:
  uv run python -m pydantic src/my_project/models/

test-ci: test
  @just -f ~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/python.just -d . test-ci
```

This preserves "delegate, never reimplement" while letting projects layer on the adversarial depth their domain requires.

## Hooks

Pre-commit and pre-push hooks block on `just test`. Install the centralized global hook collection from `~/ai-review-ci/global-hooks/`:

```bash
just --justfile ~/ai-review-ci/justfile install-global-hooks
```

## Global Configs

The QC system uses these configs (all stored in `~/ai-review-ci/tool-configs/`):

| Config | Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ruff-global.toml` | Ruff | Python linting (E, F, I, UP), Python 3.14, strict |
| `mypy-global.ini` | Mypy | Python type checking, strict mode |
| `pytest-local.ini` | pytest | Python test configuration |
| `pyproject.toml` | Various | Python project metadata |
| `biome.json` | Biome | TypeScript/JS formatting and linting |
| `eslint.config.js` | ESLint | TypeScript/JS linting |
| `knip.json` | Knip | TypeScript/JS dead code detection |
| `semgrep.yml` | Semgrep | Custom security and quality rules |
| `grain.toml` | Grain | Unused code and low-quality pattern detection |
| `.jscpd.json` | jscpd | Copy-paste detection |
| `sgconfig.yml` | ast-grep | Custom AST-based rules |
| `lintstagedrc.mjs` | lint-staged | Pre-commit hook staged file processing |
| `.slopconfig.yaml` | ai-slop-detector | AI-generated code detection |
| `.coveragerc` | coverage.py | Coverage configuration |
| `ast-grep/rules/` | ast-grep | Custom rule definitions |

## Workflows

### Local Development

```bash
just test       # Run all local QC checks
just test-ci    # Run all checks including CI-specific ones
```

### CI Pipeline

Projects should run `just test-ci` in CI to match local + CI checks.

## Assertion Policy vs QC Policy

Project tests must not enforce generic policy by inspecting code shape or asserting absence of banned constructs.

Global QC owns policy policing:

- mocks/fakes/stubs;
- type ignores and `as any`;
- runtime defaults/fallbacks;
- skip/xfail;
- source suppression;
- local QC surfaces;
- stderr suppression;
- exact-string assertion patterns where mechanically detectable.

Project tests own behavior proof:

- real boundary exercised;
- semantic output asserted;
- side effects verified;
- structured errors checked;
- independent oracles used.

Do not scatter policy-policing tests into projects.
For assertion constraints, see the central [Test Guidelines](../test-guidelines/SKILL.md).

## Key Principle

**Delegate, never reimplement.** Local projects use global QC infrastructure.
The QC agent owns rule changes, not individual projects.

## When QC Fails

When any QC check fails, the triage directive (the banner beginning with "QC FAILURE — TRIAGE REQUIRED") is emitted alongside the tool output.
This directive tells agents exactly what to do next: enter triage mode, present findings to the user, and delegate review and fix to separate subagents.

### Immediate Response

When a QC check fails:

1. **The triage directive is already in the output.** Read it.
   Follow it.
2. **Load `reviewing-llm-code/references/qc-triage.md`** for the complete triage protocol — the rules about not probing QC configs, not self-fixing, and the subagent workflow.
3. **Load `reality-grounded-debugging`** only after the triage workflow is underway, if the failure requires deeper diagnostic work.
   It provides:
   - Command-output discipline (preserve stdout, stderr, exit code)
   - Surface classification (fixture, boundary log, intermediate dump, schema dump, diagnostic recipe, subprocess capture)
   - A synthesis gate (raw observation, smallest reproducer, missing surface, verification path)

### Triage vs. Debugging

| Phase | Action | Skill |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Triage** | Present findings to user. Do not self-fix. Delegate to subagents. | `reviewing-llm-code/references/qc-triage.md` |
| **Debugging** | Investigate opaque errors after triage is complete. | `reality-grounded-debugging` |

The triage protocol takes priority over debugging.
Do not start debugging until the triage workflow (present to user → get approval → spawn subagents) has completed.
